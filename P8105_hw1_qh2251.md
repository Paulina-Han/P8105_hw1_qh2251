# Problem 1

``` r
set.seed(12)

df_1 = tibble(
  vec_numeric = rnorm(10),
  vec_logical = vec_numeric>0,
  vec_char = c("a", "b", "c", "d","e","f","g","h","i","j"),
  vec_factor = factor(c("blue","blue","blue","red","red","red","yellow","yellow","yellow","yellow"))
  )

mean(pull(df_1,vec_numeric))
```

    ## [1] -0.4672139

``` r
mean(pull(df_1,vec_logical))
```

    ## [1] 0.2

``` r
mean(pull(df_1,vec_char))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(df_1, vec_char)): 参数不是数值也不是逻辑值：回覆NA

    ## [1] NA

``` r
mean(pull(df_1,vec_factor))
```

    ## Warning in mean.default(pull(df_1, vec_factor)): 参数不是数值也不是逻辑值：回覆
    ## NA

    ## [1] NA

The numerical and logical vectors work,but the character and factor
vectors don’t work.

``` r
mean(as.numeric(pull(df_1,vec_logical)))
mean(as.numeric(pull(df_1,vec_char)))
mean(as.numeric(pull(df_1,vec_factor)))
```

the `mean` function works for the converted logical vector and the
converted factor vector.However the `mean` function doesn’t work for the
converted character vector.

the `as.numeric` function set TRUE to 1 and FALSE to 0 for the logical
vector.the `as.numeric` function set “blue” to 1,“red” to 2,“yellow” to
3 for the factor vector. In this way the `mean` function works. All
characters were converted to NA by `as.numeric` function so it won’t
work for the `mean` function.

So when you try to take the mean of a vector , you have to make sure it
is a numerical vector.logical vectors can be treated as numerical
vectors by default of `mean`function.

# Problem 2

``` r
library(palmerpenguins)

#load the data from the package
data("penguins", package = "palmerpenguins")

#name and important values of the data

#species
Adelie = sum(pull(penguins,species) == 'Adelie')
Chinstrap = sum(pull(penguins,species) == 'Chinstrap')
Gentoo = sum(pull(penguins,species) == 'Gentoo')
#body_mass
na = sum(is.na(pull(penguins,body_mass_g)))
body_mass_mean = mean(pull(penguins,body_mass_g))
body_mass_min = min(pull(penguins,body_mass_g))
body_mass_max = max(pull(penguins,body_mass_g))

#flipper_length
na_flipper = sum(is.na(pull(penguins,flipper_length_mm)))
flipper_length_mm_mean = mean(pull(penguins,flipper_length_mm),na.rm = T)
flipper_length_mm_min = min(pull(penguins,flipper_length_mm),na.rm = T)
flipper_length_mm_max = max(pull(penguins,flipper_length_mm),na.rm = T)

#size of the data set
row = nrow(penguins)
col = ncol(penguins)

#mean flipper length(removing all NAs)
mean=mean(pull(penguins,flipper_length_mm),na.rm = TRUE)
```

The species is a factor variable which has 152 Adelie penguins, 68
Chinstrap penguins and 124 Gentoo penguins.

The body\_mass\_g is a numeric variable with 2 missing values. The mean
is NA, the minimum is NA, the maximum is NA.

The flipper\_length\_mm is a numeric variable with 2 missing values. The
mean is 200.9152047 , the minimum is 172, the maximum is 231 .

There are 344 rows and 8 columns in the data set.

The mean flipper length is200.9152047.
